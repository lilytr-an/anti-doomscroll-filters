## progressive web apps

a progressive web app (PWA) is a type of web application designed to offer a more app-like experience on the web. like a mobile app, it provides features like offline support, push notifications, and fast loading times, while still being accessible through a web browser.

**to recieve push notifications from instagram whilst maintaining control over the content displayed on the app, use the instagram PWA!**

1. from the mobile browser, select `Add to home screen` and install the app.
2. once the app is installed, it will be visible on your device's homescreen. open it and accept notifications to recieve push notifications.
3. configure notification settings as desired in your instagram settings (in-app)

### reddit

strips EVERYTHING from the site except for individual posts and account information (posts, comments etc...). reddit can only be used for viewing a single post and comments, both the main feed (reddit.com) and subreddit feeds are blank to prevent mindless scrolling.
